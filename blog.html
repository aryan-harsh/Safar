	<h2>The Journey</h2>

	<img src="Photos/single-quotation-mark.jpg" class="thumbnail">
	<p class="first">Day 0 of the Delhi Trip was the day of journey for half of us and the preparation day for the other half, the Ranchi faction, who'll be boarding a flight to Delhi on July 3rd. Whereas I departed from Patna on 2 July 0:11am , midnight to reach Mirzapur at 5:30 am. From there I and Shashwat went on to Delhi.  </p>
	<p>
	"Well I was pretty much excited and yes, I had to wake up all night, which I pretty much did, watching FIFA and youtube then. Shashwat came to pick me up at the station. We left for Allahabad at noon , and for most part of the journey, I dozed off, getting the much needed sleep. At Allahabad we went for some shopping at Civil Lines , and later momos and samosa. Near 8'O clock we went to Allahabad Junction, to board Humsafar at 10:20. The newly started train was a beauty and the ride was pretty comfortable. "

	</p>
	<p>
	On the other hand , Aryan and Ritik, still at Ranchi completed their packing. Did their final checks and geared up for the next day. 
Well it was sure gonna be a big big day.

	<h2>Day 1, Everyone's here</h2>

	<img src="Photos/single-quotation-mark.jpg" class="thumbnail">
<p class="first">The fun begins

Day 1 of our trip was the day when we all reached Delhi. 

The Ranchi faction via a flight and the other via Humsafar express from Allahabad. 
</p>
<p>
Here's what the Humsafar peeps had to say about their arrival :

"   Well we were amazed at the sheer structure and planning when we arrived at Anand Vihar Terminal. We unboarded the train, went in the subway, exited anvt and hi, we were the metro station. Pretty much impressed by the spectacle. We were Happy . Excited. Cheerful.

We were pretty excited as it was like our first autonomous metro ride. We had to do things ourselves. Figure out the route ourselves( blue line, yellow line ... ) , get the ticket/tickets (we couldn't say ) . And ya another one, find which way to go. For the station was vast and full of metros . Well we were enthusiastic and found our way, went up and down using the escalator, for Shashwat wouldn't use the stairs. 
</p><p>
The metro was very fast ,and the halts, gosh they were spooky. Now we went at around 8'0 clock , the office going hour and so the traffic was at peak and the metro was full . But I won't say it was uncomfortable, for the metro was fast it was cool in there , both kewl and thanda. For us peeps living in non metropolitan cities, this was one hell of a ride, it matched all our requirements, fast, cheap, air conditioned , cool. A 40 ruppee ticket, and compare it with the auto charges of Jhalwa to CL. Well after playing with inertia for quite a while, we finally arrived at New Delhi metro station.

At New Delhi station , we sat on a bench for a whee while to pass our time, and ya check our Google maps. We were sitting amongst the hustle bustle of busy Delhi metro. A metro passing us every now and then. Ek gaya nhi ki doosra aa jata tha. Cool tha.  

A 1.3 km walk under the sun , and ho, we were at our hotel, drenched in sweat .   "
</p><p>
And here's the viewpoint of the Ranchi Duo:



Well after Ranchi Duo came, we all 

just had a brief hi hello session, and got ready for Akshardham.

 Akshardham:


Remove all and any stereotypes you have about a temple , for its nothing like the others , its Akshardham. 
</p><p>
Traversing thought the maze Delhi metro is( not really) , we finally reached Akshardham at around 3pm. Cutting a long story short, Akshardham was a surreal beauty. It was better than any of the monuments of Delhi. It never stopped amazing us throughout the evening. The theatre, the boat ride, the magnificent temple and finally the best part of our visit , the one and only, Sahaj Anand water show, a fantabuluos mix of foundation, lasers, music, fire , and projections, which created a ethereal aura. We were completely baffeld and mesmerized by the sheer magnificence of the event. And even walking around the temple at night, simply gazing at its intricate carvings , accentuated further by the multilinear lights, was simply enough to make your day. Every moment at the place was cherished. 

</p><p>
The building was completely covered with the light and projection.  It was perfect. The fountains danced with the music, the water went high , meeting the lasers in the sky. It produced a mystic sparkling effect which was wonderful. The water show depicted an entire story, with morals and humor alike. The teasings of the children were on our lips  when we departed. The show was worth every penny of the money, time and effort we invested. 

We also had food in the cafeteria for lunch and it was quite good. For our dinner, we chose Haldirams.

	<h2>Day2: Worlds of Wonder</h2>

	<img src="Photos/single-quotation-mark.jpg" class="thumbnail">
	<p class="first">Literally WOW!!!

Well they say, this was the best part of the trip. And Yes it was.  Worlds of Wonder, India's fourth largest water park or something something. It was really great. 

We first went to the amusement park, which really was quite amusing. We were thrilled at almost all the rides , they were simply amazing. Not all of us could even garner enough courage to go through all the rides , for the rides were frightening even in plain sight. But experiencing it was a whole new feeling. It was adventure. It was risk. It was fun. It was adrenaline rush. It was too good an experience. Well the ride which had us skip our heartbeat was the gravity one for sure. Well they lifted us up and all of a sudden we were sent hurling downwards, it seemed as if we are falling in an abyss. And then as you went down enough, it cushioned you up. Next up we had gip wala ride. Well that as well was one hell of a ride. Remember we studied Degree of freedom  Freedom of motion something.  Well we just experienced that here. For moments we just kept looking at the sun or the mall , upside down , hanging from the belt. And then all of a sudden, it would switch and swing and what not and you were shocked beyond relief with all this. You never knew what was coming next.
</p>
<p>
These were the major rides in the  amusement park, there were others too but these just were fkin awesome . We also did car takrane wala. There was that fast forward ride where you'd be thrown to one end of the wagon. 

After the rides, we had a refreshments break, before proceeding on to the best part, or so they say, The water Park.  

Rain dance, lazy river, tumbling buckets, wave pool and all the different range of water slides from free fall to the kids slides, it was all there. And the best of them all were the water slides. They were so high , so fkin high. And freefall , that was THE most dangerously amazing ride I've ever been to. It was beyond amazing. Well to describe it, you'd be pushed into a completely closed tube, like usually rides have it upper half open. But here it's closed and as soon as it opens, hoah, you're falling, falling down . Your body lifts up. You lose contact with the ride. And experience free fall and then gradually you find contact with the ride and come down. Well that's just words. The experience is beyond it all. It's so thrilling that you'll be shut to silence, you won't be able to shout the time you freefall.
</p><p>
There were many other amazing water rides, boomerang , red wala, green wala, blue wala, well that's how we called it. 
The rides were so terrifying that half of us couldn't even dare to go to some. Or even go to free fall twice. 

Then comes the wave pool. We enjoyed the wave pool twice. Every hour it would be there but we weren't . But when we were it was too good. The water, the waves were so strong it'd throw you off. There were so strong that if you dint resist, you'd be knocked off , and tumble. Well that was sooo much fun. 
</p><p>
The lazy river , as the name suggests , was a thing meant for simply chilling , or say, relaxing. It was a 3 feet deep circular canal kind of structure . And people were given tubes to sit on and enjoy their lazy ride. Well Shashwat's favourite , it was a perfect place to go to after all those ferocious rides and them waves. You could enjoy in peace. And enjoy we did. 
 
After all that we could enjoy in wow, which means after it was close shut, we went on to GIP and DLF mall one after the other. At one we(not the veg boi Shashwat and pseudo veg aryan) had chicken murg musallam, from a Lucknowi food chain.

	<h4>6 July 2018</h4>
	<h2>Day4: Discovering Dilli!!</h2>

	<img src="Photos/single-quotation-mark.jpg" class="thumbnail">
	<p class="first">The second last day. After almost completing all the far away places in our Delhi visitlist, we were now left to enjoy Delhi .
We were staying in another hotel, which was just adjacent to McD , so we decided to have breakfast at McD as it was close and affordably comfortable. After having a bunch of burgers, fries, and pepsi, we decided that we'll go to national science centre, yes the days schedule was not decided or fixed from before.
</p><p>
So we boarded a metro and consequently changed the line and boarded another, and well reached the metro station closest to our destination. And well we could see the Supreme Court from our metro station. Boarding an auto, we reached NSC. Got the tickets for entry and a 3D show, and entered. Well National Science Centre Delhi was like any other Science Centre for most of the part. Informative yet fun. Fun to we pakka had, toying around and playing . 
Drank lassi, too cold.<br> 
After this We returned to Cannaught Place for our lunch. The veggies ate at Sarvana Bhavan and ritik too had something.  The non veg enthusiasts headed at Pape the hotel. Pape the hotel was a famous, always crowded, renowned place for non vegetarians. After a stomach fulfilling meal there, we proceeded to Gianis where ritik bought two scoops of brownie choco icecream. At this point we reunited with Aryan and shashwat, who were gone to buy shoes for Aryan and flute for Shashwat. 
</p><p>
From here We again began touring Canaught Place , in our hunt for posters and other things to buy. So we found what we were looking for and purchased a variety of posters for each of us and for litroom too. After the posters we decided to move to India Gate . So we boarded an auto, which dropped us near India Gate. 
<br>
What's a trip without fukups . What's a day without challenges. 

So to complete our trips rightful quota of fukups, this day was somehow selected. Destiny. 
</p><p>
Well we saw India Gate ahead and Rashtrapati Bhavan behind. Rashtrapati Bhavan looked no more than a kilometre and at most a km and a half away. And the sun was setting towards Rashtrapati Bhavan. So in a brilliant stroke of Intelligence, me and Shashwat decided that we need to walk on to Rashtrapati Bhavan and back to India Gate. After a little opposition and reconciliation, We started walking towards Rashtrapati Bhavan. And We kept walking and walking and walking for like an entire hour, covering about 4 kms. It never seemed to arrive. At evert chowk or traffic light, you'd see another one a little distance away, another one which was not visible like a minute ago.  After this endless and super tiring walk, we got close enough to Presidential Palace to get some nice clicks and after it, we finally got to our brains and decided to take an auto back to India Gate,( or could have taken to CP as Aryan wanted).
We were soon at India Gate and it was crowded and lit up with tricolor and pinkish hue. IT looked amazing . After getting close enough, or rather the closest that was allowed, we admired the beauty it was and ya clicked pics. Hail harshagram. Hail ams. Finally, tired af, We decided unanimously to return back and have dinner.
</p><p>
Wait the fuckup part is not over, not so soon bruh. Well , simply saying we went from restaurant to restaurant , in search of an ideal place for dinner. After entering , drinking water and exiting some hotels , Pind Balucchi amonsgt them , we split up and one half bought pizza and other Burger. Some of us wanted a complete dinner  and were hit the most by the dinner debacle. Well maybe it doesn't seem much of a debacle to you, but just imagine , you're completely tired, have walked around 4-5 Kms in a stretch and before it entire CP and much more . Now you're hungry and want nothing more that a complete roti sabzi wali dinner. Nothing else. But you go from one hotel to another in search of it but to no avail, We almost went from one corner of CP to another, in search of food. So stupid. So simply bad. Well at last We bought packed chocolate paan, and went straight to our hotel on a ola.</p>
